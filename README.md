# Projects
This project contains the 

## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Control
For this project, we train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent by DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm to control the acceleration of an AV. This AV can help relieve the traffic congestion in modern traffic system. 

## Traffic Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles in SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
Test the AV with the trained controller in the traffic simulator SUMO. SUMO is connected with Python by the API, TraCI, for information transfer, data acquisition and analysis.

## Deep Learning for Object Recognition
Train Deep neural networks on different datasets (Imagenet, VGGFace2, GTSRB, etc.) with different network architectures (Alexnet, DenseNet, ResNet, etc.) by Pytorch and Tensorflow.

## Statitic Learning for Industry Process
Perform statistic learning techniques in Matlab, e.g., PCA (Principal Component Analysis), FDA (Fisher Discriminant Analysis), to extract the latent features of industry process data, e.g. Tennessee-Eastman benchmark process, for data modeling and fault diagnosis.

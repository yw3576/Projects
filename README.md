# Projects
`I summarize my projects during my Ph.D.`

### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Control
Train a DRL agent with the DDPG algorithm in Python to control the AV's acceleration, potentially reducing traffic congestion.\
[Codes are provided in](../DRL/DRL.ipynb)

### Traffic Simulation for AVs in SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
Test the AV with the trained controller in the traffic simulator SUMO, which is connected to Python via the TraCI API for data transfer, acquisition, and analysis. \
Codes are provided in
`Traffic\control_test.ipynb`

### Deep Learning for Object Recognition
Train deep neural networks using PyTorch and TensorFlow on various datasets (Imagenet, VGGFace2, GTSRB) and network architectures (Alexnet, DenseNet, ResNet).\
Codes are provided in
`DL\`

### Statitic Learning for Industry Process
Apply statistical learning techniques like PCA and FDA in Matlab to extract latent features from industry process data (e.g. Tennessee-Eastman benchmark process). This is used for data modeling and fault diagnosis.\

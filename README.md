# Projects
`I summarize my projects during my Ph.D.`

### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Control
`Train a DRL agent with the DDPG algorithm in Python to control the AV's acceleration, potentially reducing traffic congestion.`\
[Codes](./DRL/DRL.ipynb)

### Traffic Simulation for AVs in SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
`Test the AV with the trained controller in the traffic simulator SUMO, which is connected to Python via the TraCI API for data transfer, acquisition, and analysis.` \
[Codes](./Traffic/control_test.ipynb)

### Deep Learning for Object Recognition
`Train deep neural networks using PyTorch and TensorFlow on various datasets (Imagenet, VGGFace2, GTSRB) and network architectures (Alexnet, DenseNet, ResNet).`\
[Codes](./DL/DL.py)

### Statitic Learning for Industry Process
`Apply statistical learning techniques like PCA and FDA in Matlab to extract latent features from industry process data (e.g. Tennessee-Eastman benchmark process). This is used for data modeling and fault diagnosis.`

# Projects
## Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicle Control
### For this project, we train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent by DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm to control the acceleration of an AV. This AV can help relieve the traffic congestion in modern traffic system. 

## Traffic Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles in SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
